# Integrated Management Systems: Medical Clinic, Events and Restaurant

## 📌 Project Description

This project consists of a **Java application** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It simulates **three distinct management systems**, integrated into a single platform:

- 🏥 Medical Clinic  
- 🎟️ Event Management System  
- 🍽️ Restaurant Management System  

The main goal is to apply core OOP concepts such as **encapsulation, abstraction, modularity, and code reuse**, while demonstrating how different business domains can be integrated to support **strategic decision-making**.

- Nunno Wakiyama Diniz Carvalho  
- Pedro Henrique Mendes Macedo  
- Ricardo Nery de Brito Junior  
- Matheus Fabiano Barbosa Aguiar  
- **Noemi Soares Gonçalves da Silva**

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Java  
- Develop independent yet integrated systems  
- Simulate real-world management scenarios  
- Use generated data to support decision-making  
- Build a modular, scalable, and well-structured system  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Scanner (console input)**
- **Collections (ArrayList)**
- **Control structures and interactive menus**

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The project is divided into **four main modules**:

1. Medical Clinic Management System  
2. Event Management System  
3. Restaurant Management System  
4. Integrated System (Decision Support)

---

## 🏥 Case 1: Medical Clinic Management System

This module allows:

- Registration of doctors and patients  
- Appointment scheduling  
- Doctor availability verification  
- Identification of the most requested doctor  

### Main Classes

- **Clinic**
  - Core system class
  - Manages doctors, patients, and appointments
  - Key methods:
    - `addDoctor()`
    - `addPatient()`
    - `addAppointment()`
    - `mostRequestedDoctor()`
    - `doctorSchedule()`

- **Patient**
  - Stores patient information such as name, age, symptoms, health insurance, and blood type
  - Getters and setters
  - Method `hasHealthInsurance()`

- **Doctor**
  - Stores name, specialization, CRM, and availability
  - Appointment counter
  - Methods:
    - `isAvailable()`
    - `incrementAppointmentCount()`

- **Appointment**
  - Connects doctor and patient
  - Stores date, time, and priority
  - Method `possiblePriority()`

---

## 🎟️ Case 2: Event Management System

This system is responsible for:

- Event creation and management  
- Participant registration  
- Capacity control  
- Report generation  

### Main Classes

- **Event**
  - Manages participants, attractions, and capacity
  - Methods:
    - `registerParticipant()`
    - `checkCapacity()`
    - `generateReport()`

- **Location**
  - Represents the event venue
  - Attributes: name and address
  - Overrides `toString()` for better display

- **main_event**
  - Interactive console interface
  - Manages events, participants, and locations
  - Uses menus and input validation

---

## 🍽️ Case 3: Restaurant Management System

This module provides full restaurant control:

- Table management  
- Order registration  
- Menu item handling  
- Bill calculation and checkout  

### Main Classes

- **Restaurant**
  - Core system class
  - Manages up to 15 tables
  - Methods:
    - `initializeTables()`
    - `placeOrder()`
    - `closeBill()`

- **Table**
  - Represents restaurant tables
  - Methods:
    - `reserve()`
    - `release()`

- **OrderItem**
  - Represents menu items
  - Attributes: name, price, and portion size

- **Order**
  - Manages ordered items
  - Methods:
    - `addItem()`
    - `removeItem()`
    - `calculateTotal()`

---

## 🔗 Case 4: System Integration

The **IntegratedSystem** class connects all modules through a unified main menu, allowing:

- Centralized access to all systems  
- Report generation  
- Strategic questions such as:
  - Most requested doctor
  - Most popular event
  - Most ordered restaurant item

This integration highlights the use of **abstraction, modular design, and data reuse**.

---

## 📊 Decision Support

The system answers strategic questions based on data generated by all modules, supporting performance analysis and informed decision-making.

## 📌 Project Status

✅ Finished  
📚 Academic project  
🧠 Maintained as learning material and portfolio reference  

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project resulted in a robust, modular, and integrated system that effectively applies Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
The clear separation of responsibilities and system integration provide a solid foundation for future improvements, such as graphical interfaces, database persistence, or additional business modules.
